# Madden NFL 21 Cheat Table

Tested on Cheat Engine 6.81 and 7.1.

If you don't know how to use script then check its description (right click on script -> change script, or open .CT file with notepad).

**For Franchise Mode you need to use Offline Save, otherwise some features may not work.**

If you use Trial Game version then you need to modify `Madden21.exe` to `Madden21_Trial.exe` in every script.
